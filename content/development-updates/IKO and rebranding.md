**Dear community,**

We are very sorry that we have to inform you about the change of date of our Initial Kitty Offering(IKO). We were planning to start our IKO on 31st of March and allow the players to purchase first 6 breeds of Kitties in a different price ranges and they will be purchasable with SKY and BTC. While our mission remains the same we have to reschedule our IKO date.

Our IKO will be delayed by approximately one month. We are fully committed to open and direct communication with our players and we want you to know what is the reason of the delay. Over the last two months, we were working eagerly on creating a game that meets the expectations of our players. Our main focus was and still is the development of a technical infrastructure necessary to achieve our goal of better crypto-collectable with extensive gaming possibilities. We were confident that we could achieve this by the end of March. Due to complications in our breeding algorithm and Kitty-DNA we discovered that we have to re-design this crucial component of our game to achieve the best results. The breeding algorithm we were working on over the last month would have led to the creation of unintended mutations if these issues were not addressed. Over the next month, we are going to focus on a new Kitty-DNA design to prevent this occurrence. As soon as this is completed we will launch our Initial Kitty Offering.

We are confident that KittyCash is a revolutionary blockchain game that will place a cornerstone for the future development of games built on Skycoin’s Fiber blockchain. We will be working on developing our project throughout the future. We are working extremely hard to deliver a game that will be innovative, interesting to play, fast and without the issues of Ethereum-based games. For that, we partnered with top talented developers, designers, and artists to create an eye-catching design for our Kitties, and user interface of the whole platform and aim for the highest quality performance.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we tackle this unforeseen issue. As a thank you for your interest and trust, we would like to grow the engagement of the community even more and it is our great pleasure to introduce the KittyCash Bounty Hunt program that will allow our community to perform specified tasks to get rewards! KittyCash Bounty Hunt will be launched on 27th of March on our website.

We are furthermore delighted to announce the re-launch and rebranding of our [website](https://www.kittycash.com/home) and logo. Over the last two weeks, our design team was working on a design of the whole KittyCash brand and we believe that our new brand identity fits our vision better.
